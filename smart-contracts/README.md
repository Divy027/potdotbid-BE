# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```

Todo
1) Test chainlink Upkeep for automatic calls 
2) every month to every day for random selection
3) selected address can sell 10% of their holding
4) Change fees of bonding contract (pump fun)
